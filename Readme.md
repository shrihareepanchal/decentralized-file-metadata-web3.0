# Decentralized File Metadata Storage

## 1. Project Title
**Decentralized File Metadata Storage (DFMS)**

## 2. Project Description
The DFMS smart contract allows users to store and retrieve metadata of files in a decentralized way on the Stacks blockchain. Each file is identified by a unique file ID, and its metadata includes:
- File name
- IPFS (or other storage) hash

By storing metadata on-chain, file information remains immutable and publicly accessible without centralized control.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to enable a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, and transparent file information registry, ensuring that users can verify file authenticity and origin without relying on centralized databases.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Access Control:** Add owner-based access for metadata editing.
- **Versioning:** Allow multiple versions of file metadata.
- **NFT Integration:** Link files to NFTs for ownership tracking.
- **Extended Metadata:** Add fields like description, size, and MIME type.
- **Off-chain Storage Bridges:** Connect with IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave for actual file storage.
